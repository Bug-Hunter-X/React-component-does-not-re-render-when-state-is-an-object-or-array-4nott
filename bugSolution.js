This React component uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the state update. This ensures that the component re-renders only when the state changes. The `useMemo` hook takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The function is executed only when one of the dependencies changes. In this case, the function returns the updated state. The array of dependencies contains the state object. The component will re-render whenever the state object changes.
