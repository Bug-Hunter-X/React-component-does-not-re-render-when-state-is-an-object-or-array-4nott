This React component uses the `useState` hook to manage its state. However, it does not handle the case where the initial state is an object or an array. When the state is updated, the component does not re-render because React does not perform a deep comparison of objects or arrays. This can lead to unexpected behavior. The solution is to use the `useMemo` hook to memoize the state update. This will ensure that the component re-renders only when the state changes.
